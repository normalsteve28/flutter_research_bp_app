  """\t\tA Myocardial Infarction, more commonly recognized as a Heart Attack, is a condition that disturbs your heart\’s rhythm and its ability to pump blood throughout the body. 

    Damages of higher severity may ensue from the irregularity of the heart\’s function caused by an attack. 

    Possible risks include kidney disorders, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and another heart attack.  

    This health issue occurs when a coronary artery is blocked, resulting in the loss of blood traveling to a cardiac muscle. 

    The heart becomes exceedingly deprived of oxygen and other nutrients necessary for it to function and remain healthy. 
    
    During cases of Heart attack, First Aid is essential in minimalizing injury and preventing impairment to the cardiovascular system. This can also be done while waiting for professional help. 
    
The procedures are as follows: 
1. Calm the person down to avoid further aggravation.
2. Let him or her sit down and relax.
3. If the person is wearing tight clothing, loosen it up. 
4. If he or she possesses medication for their diagnosed heart condition, assist them in taking it. 
5. Call for emergency help if pain persists after resting or 3 minutes after taking medication.
6. Begin CPR procedures or call a local emergency number if the person is unresponsive or is not breathing.

  '''   Certain conditions can lead to the events of a heart attack. One of which is a disease called hypertension.
    
    Hypertension, or High Blood Pressure, is when a person\’s blood pressure is higher than normal. 
The long-term force of blood on the artery walls creates damage on the surface and can cease the flow of blood to the cardiac muscle. 
This may result in future health issues concerning that of your heart. 

    This condition comes in stages, ranging in severity. These stages are as follows:
Stage 1: 
    This first stage is considered the "normal" stage. The systolic level of an individual will be less than 130 mm Hg and the diastolic rate will be less than 80 mm Hg. An individual would not need care at this stage due to its normality. It is still necessary to monitor your blood pressure for the preservation of your health. 

Stage 2: 
    This process is known as prehypertension. Systolic Hg is between 130 and 139 mm and diastolic Hg between 80 and 89 mm. Prevention can still be applied at this stage. However, they are at risk of hypertension which could lead to subsequent heart disease or stroke. 
At this point, medicine is often not prescribed. However, to prevent hypertension, a person must make changes to his or her lifestyle. This could mean quitting cigarettes or making dietary alterations. Exercise is another good step to reducing your blood pressure.

Stage 3: 
    This is the stage in which a person is at risk of various health complications. Systolic is between 140 and 159 mm Hg, and diastolic between 90 and 99 mm Hg. An individual has advised medication at this point to decrease their blood pressure and risk of heart attack and/or stroke. 

Stage 4: 
    Diastolic is at 160 mm Hg or higher and systolic at 100 mm Hg or higher. This stage is the most severe and has the highest risk of coronary heart disease. Stricter changes in daily regimen are applied concerning diets, exercise, and lifestyle.

Blood pressure
''',
  '''   A way to gauge your health is through the heart rate.

    The Heart Rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Pulses are often most prominent in areas such as the insides of the elbow, wrists, side of the neck, and top of the foot. 
    
    Heart rates per individual may vary depending on factors like physical activeness and medication intake. A normal or resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 BPM (Beats Per Minute). This may vary with athletes. Numbers consistently above and below that range may indicate underlying problems.
''',
  '''   The best way to maintain adequate heart health is by modifying destructive habits and including practices beneficial to your body\’s well-being. 

    Reducing your body\’s intake of added sugars, sodium, and fats (saturated and trans) by substituting these with whole foods may help prevent the build-up of cholesterol in the arteries and provide your body with the nutrition it needs. 

    Exercising can also help in boosting muscle strength, endurance, and efficiency of the cardiovascular system. 
This can enhance the body\’s ability to distribute oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. 
Additionally, a person attains a healthy weight through physical activity. 

    It is also necessary to cut out habits such as smoking, excessive intake of caffeine or alcohol, and intake of illegal drugs that may aggravate your body\’s overall health and lead to a weaker functioning body.
